# Ecommerce Follow Along Project
Welcome to the **Ecommerce Follow Along Project**, this is a hands-on project we will build a complete e-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDb, Express.js, React.js and Node.js). The goal is to learn hoe to develop a full-stack web application step by step.

## Milestone 1: Project overview

#### 1. UnderStanding the MERN stack:
 **MongoDB :** A database for storing application data in a flexibla , document based format.
 **Express.js :** A backend web application framework for building APIs and handling server logics.
 **React.js :** A framework library for building User Interfaces.
 **Node.js :** A runtime environment that allows javascript to run on the server.

 #### 2. REST API Structure
 REST APIs are used to allow communication between the frontend and backend.
 We'll create APIs for:
 - **User Authentication**: Allowing user to register and log in.
 - **Product Management**: Adding, Updating, and retreving product data.
 - **Order Handling**: Managing customer orders.

#### 3. Database Schema Design
We'll learn how to design and organize data using MongoDB. A schema help us define how the data is stored and related.

#### 4. Authentication
Authentication ensures only the right pepole can access certain feautures. For Example:
- Users need to log in to place orders or see their personal data.
- It keeps the app secure by verifying users' identities.

#### SECTION 2:
> Milestone 2:
- In this i create a react app and design the login page and style it Tailwindcss. It gives a wonderful Experience and i get some knowledge that how to work on a professional project.

#### Milestone 3:
Set up dedicated folders for organizing backend code efficiently. Initialized and configured a Node.js server to handle API request. Connected the application to MongoDB to store and manage the data.

## Milestone 4:
  Created a User Model to define how user data is structured in the database also developed a user interactions, like adding or retrieving data. Additionally, configured Multer to handle file uploads, allowing users to store files such as images.Adding
